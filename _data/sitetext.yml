    title: "About"
    text: "I'm a burlesque performer living in the north side of Chicago. I'm an avid board gamer, constant reader, and inept but enthusiastic racquetball player. Yeah, Jean LeFaun's not my real name, but it's much more fun than my birth name! Blame it on Fantasia or blame it on Mr. Tumnus, but I've always identified with satyrs. Those Dionysian emissaries of fun, laughs, good times, and pan flutes live life on their own terms. If you're looking for a resume, congrats! You found it. <a href=assets/jshannin_resume.pdf>It's right here</a>. If you're looking for something more visual, check out my portfolio below."
