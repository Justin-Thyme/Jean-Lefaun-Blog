    text: "I'm a burlesque performer living in the north side of Chicago. I'm an avid board gamer, constant reader, and inept but enthusiastic racquetball player. If you're looking for a resume, congrats! You found it. It's right here.\n
\n
    So why the name Jean LeFaun? Blame it on Fantasia or blame it on Mr. Tumnus, but I've always identified with satyrs. Those Dionysian emissaries of fun, laughs, good times, and pan flutes live life on their own terms. They cavort and carouse, rejecting the polished perfection of Adonis in favor of the raw and natural.
\n
    My burlesque style is similar. I might not dazzle you with rhinestones or titillate you with Chippendales sex stud realness. But I can guarantee you a number that's brimming with energy and totally unique. If you're intrigued, check out my portfolio below."
