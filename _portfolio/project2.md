In my spare time, I enjoy creating AMVs, also known as anime music videos, where I set footage from anime shows to music. Some examples
[Death Note set to Wicked] (https://youtu.be/znFvXteROus)
[Attack on Titan x RuPaul] (https://youtu.be/ymaqzHauEV0)
[Elfen Lied x Liza Minnelli] (https://youtu.be/PtvhcLApV9Y)
